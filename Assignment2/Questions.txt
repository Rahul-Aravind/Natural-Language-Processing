1. Rule Based POS Tagging (30 points)
For this question, you have been given a POS-tagged training file,
HW2_F15_NLP6320_POSTaggedTrainingSet.txt, that has been tagged with POS tags
from the Penn Treebank POS tagset (Figure 5.6). Use this POS tagged file to compute
for each word w the tag t that maximizes P(t|w). Retag the training file with POS tags
that are most probable for a given word. Compute the error rate by comparing the
retagged file against the original tagged file. Now perform error analysis to find the 
top-5 erroneously tagged words. Write at least five rules to do a better job of tagging
these top-5 erroneously tagged words, and show the difference in error rates.


2. HMM Decoding: Viterbi Algorithm (30 points):
Implement the Viterbi algorithm and run it with the HMM in Fig. 6.3 to compute the
most likely weather sequences for each of the two observation sequences, 331122313
and 331123312.
