Unsmoothed Unigram/Bigram Probabilities (25 points):

1) Write a program to compute unsmoothed unigrams and bigrams. Your program’s
correctness will be evaluated using an unseen corpus. 

2) Smoothed Unigram/Bigram Probabilities (25 points):
Add an option to your program from Question 3 to do Good-Turing discounting.
Your program’s correctness will be evaluated using the same unseen corpus as
Question 1.
